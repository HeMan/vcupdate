This script came to life after trying to update some source code and
I first tried 'git pull' then 'svn udate' to finally realize that it was a CVS
repository.

It's not supposed to be a tool to unify the VC tools, just to ease the
download of seldom used source code.

The usage is simple, just run 'vcupdate' and it figures out what VC that is
used in you working directory.
